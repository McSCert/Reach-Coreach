# Reach/Coreach Tool

Tracks and highlights data flow and control flow in a Simulink model. The tool identifies, for some specified Simulink blocks, parts of the model that depend on those blocks (Reach functionality), or parts of the model that the specified blocks depend upon (Coreach functionality). After the dependencies have been identified, the extraneous blocks can be removed via the tool's model slicing function.
